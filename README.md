# MTLSynergy

## Requirements

- python=3.7
- cuda=10.2
- pytorch=1.8.1
- sklearn=1.0.2
- pandas=1.3.5

## Start

Run the AEtrain.py first to pre-train a drug encoder and a cell line encoder, and then run the MTLSynergytrain.py to train the model.

## Data

**drugs.csv**:  Information of 3118 drugs.

**cell_lines.csv**:  Information of 175 cell lines.

**drug_features.csv**:  Features of  3118 drugs, 1213-dimensional vector for each drug.

**cell_line_features.csv**:  Features of 175 cell lines, 5000-dimensional vector for each cell lines.

**oneil_summary_idx.csv**:  22 737 samples from O'Neilï¼Œeach sample consists of two drugs id, a cell line id, synergy score of the drug combination on the cell line, respective sensitivity scores of the two drugs on the cell line.
